Below is the source map visualization for Project-Chi generated using [danvk/source-map-explorer](https://github.com/danvk/source-map-explorer).  The source map explorer command line tool determines from which file each byte in the minified JS is derived. From this data we generate a [martine/webtreemap](https://github.com/martine/webtreemap) visualization.

You can visualize your own tree map visualization using [danvk/source-map-explorer](https://github.com/danvk/source-map-explorer).  Using the `--json` or `--tsv` [option](https://github.com/danvk/source-map-explorer#options) you can to output the raw data and paste the output in the text box above (click the cog icon) to view the treemap here.
