# Project χ

Project χ (pronounced project /ˈ</span><span title="'k' in 'kind'">k</span><span title="/aɪ/ long 'i' in 'tide'">aɪ</span></span>/) is an modular open source visualization gallery toolkit.  It offers a boilerplate and toolset for building self-hosted data-centric visualization websites. Geared towards sharing of supplemental materials associated with scientific publications; Project χ allows visitors to interact with visualizations, download associated data and images, and even try the visualization with their own uploaded or publicly available datasets.  For developers the toolkit comes preconfigured with the popular design frameworks (Twitter Bootstrap, Angular UI) and cutting edge build tools (gulp, jspm, SystemJS) and examples integrating interactive visualizations using [d3.js](http://d3js.org/), [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), and [BioJS](http://biojs.io/).

**Note: Project χ is experimental.  Many things will change.  If you are interested in this project or have issues please feel free to contact me.**

## Features

* Contains AngularJS services and directives for loading, parsing, and downloading tabular data and as well as downloading generated publication quality SVG images.
* Simple,  modular, and customizable design using [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) templates and [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS framework.
* Supports CommonJS, AMD, and ES6 modules using the [SystemJS](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs) universal dynamic module loader.
* Integrate additional visualizations, including [BioJS](http://biojs.io/) and [Chiasm](https://github.com/curran/chiasm) modules, directly from any registry such as [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) or [GitHub](https://github.com/) using [JSPM](http://jspm.io/).
* Self-hosted fully client-side application doesn't require a server; easily hosted on [WebDAV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV) or [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
* For production builds ES6 into ES5 including minification and bundling using [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) and [SystemJS Builder](https://github.com/systemjs/builder).
* Modular separation of boilerplate (Project χ) and user projects.  Share tools across projects.

# For Developers

## Background

If you are not familiar it would be worthwhile to read up on [jspm](http://jspm.io/), [SystemJS](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs), and [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/).

If you don't already have jspm or gulp you should install them globally.

```bash
npm install -g gulp-cli jspm
```

## Install

```bash
git clone -b master https://github.com/Hypercubed/Project-Chi.git --single-branch --depth 1
cd Project-Chi
npm install # jspm install is run post-install by npm
```

## Run examples

```bash
gulp dev  # uses the default "example" dataset (same as gelp dev --dataset=./dataset/example)
```

## Gulp Tasks

* `gulp dev`, run development server (building is not required)
* `gulp build`, build into the `dist` directory
* `gulp dist`, build and run server from `dist` directory
* `gulp deploy`, build and push to `gh-pages`

## Separation of template and dataset

By default all content in the `app` directory will be served by the development server when running `gulp server` and built into the `dist` folder when running `gulp build`.  However, to encourage contribution back to the `project-χ` repository and enable using the same `project-χ` source across multiple projects the developer may put project specific resources and configuration into a separate directory.  This folder can then be served and built along with the `project-χ` core.  For example, if you create a `extra` folder inside the `dataset` directory the following commands will work as indicated:

* `gulp dev --dataset=./dataset/extra`

	runs the development server serving the combination of the `app` directory and `dataset/extra` directories as the web root.  Files in `dataset/extra/app` override `app` and `dataset/extra/gulp/config.js` augments (deep-extends) `gulp/config.js`.  If no dataset is given `./dataset/example` is assumed.

* The `gulp build`, `gulp dist`, `gulp deploy` all work similarly.
