# Project χ

Project χ (pronounced project /ˈ</span><span title="'k' in 'kind'">k</span><span title="/aɪ/ long 'i' in 'tide'">aɪ</span></span>/) is an modular open source visualization gallery toolkit.  It offers a framework and toolset for building self-hosted data-centric visualization websites. Geared towards sharing of supplemental materials associated with scientific publications; Project χ allows visitors to interact with visualizations, download associated data and images, and even try the visualization with their own uploaded or publicly available datasets.  For developers the framework comes preconfigured with the popular design frameworks (Twitter Bootstrap, Angular UI) and cutting edge build tools (gulp, jspm, SystemJS) and tools necessary for quickly integrating interactive visualizations using [d3.js](http://d3js.org/), [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), and [BioJS](http://biojs.io/).

## Features

* Contains AngularJS services and directives for loading, parsing, and downloading tabular data and as well as downloading generated publication quality SVG images.
* Simple,  modular, and customizable design using [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) templates and [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS framework.
* Supports CommonJS, AMD, and ES6 modules using the [SystemJS](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs) universal dynamic module loader.
* Integrate additional visualizations, including [BioJS](http://biojs.io/) and [Chiasm](https://github.com/curran/chiasm) modules, directly from any registry such as [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) or [GitHub](https://github.com/) using [JSPM](http://jspm.io/).
* Self-hosted fully client-side application doesn't require a server; easily hosted on [WebDAV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV) or [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
* For production builds ES6 into ES5 including minification and bundling using [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) and [SystemJS Builder](https://github.com/systemjs/builder).

# For Developers

## Background

If you are not familiar it would be worthwhile to read up on [JSPM](http://jspm.io/), [SystemJS](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs), and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/).

If you don't already have jspm or gulp you should install them globally.

```
npm install -g gulp jspm bower
```

## Install

```
git clone https://github.com/Hypercubed/Project-Chi.git
cd Project-Chi
npm install # jspm install is run postinstall by npm
```

## Run

```
gulp watch
```

## Gulp Tasks

* `gulp server`, run development server
* `gulp watch`, run development server and watch for file changes
* `gulp test`, run karma tests
* `gulp build`, build distribution directory
* `gulp server:dist`, run distribution server for testing
* `gulp deploy`, push to gh-pages
* `gulp run`, run development server, karma tests and watch for file changes

## File Structure

```
/root
	+- package.json         # metadata used by NPM and JSPM
	+- gulpfile.js          # gulp build script
	+- karma.conf.js        # test configuration
	+- app/                 # application resources
		+- jspm_packages/     # jspm packages are installed here
		+- components/        # site components, including tests
		+- common/						# shared tools that are not components, including tests
		+- system.config.js   # SystemJS configuration generated by jspm
		+- index.html         # single page application
	+- dataset/             # see below
	+- dist/                # build goes here
```

## Separation of template and dataset (optional)

By default all content in the `app` directory will be served by the test server when running `gulp server` and built into the `dist` folder when running `gulp build`.  However, to encourage contribution back to the `project-x` repository and enable using the same `project-x` source across multiple projects the developer may optionally put project specific data into a separate directory.  This folder can then be served and built along with the `project-x` core.  For example, if you create a `myProject` folder inside the `dataset` directory the following commands will work as indicated:

* `gulp server --dataset=./dataset/myProject`

	runs the development server serving the combination of the `app` directory and `dataset/myProject` directories as the web root.  Files in `dataset/myProject` override `app`.

* `gulp build --dataset=./dataset/myProject`

  build distribution directory combining and bundling resources from the the `app` directory and `dataset/myProject` into the `dist` directory.  Files in `dataset/myProject` override `app`.
