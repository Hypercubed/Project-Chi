# crossfilter/universe Example

An example using a [crossfilter/universe](https://github.com/crossfilter/universe).  Data Source: [ASA Data Expo](http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/) dataset.

Based on crossfilter example by [Square](http://square.github.io/crossfilter/).

With [Universe](https://github.com/crossfilter/universe), filtering large datasets is easy, without the need write intense map-reduce functions or learn the intricate inner-workings of [crossfilter](https://github.com/crossfilter/crossfilter).

This example demonstrates integration of Project-χ and Universe.  Project-χ is used for data loading and parsing while Universe (and crossfilter) handles fast filtering and interaction between the
 visualizations.
