# Chiasm plugins from CJS module

An example using [Chiasm](https://github.com/chiasm-project/chiasm).

Visualization by [Curran Kelleher](http://bl.ocks.org/curran/4b18d7b107c0e5b97407).

Chiasm is a browser based runtime environment and component architecture for interactive data visualizations. It allows plugins for data access, data transformation, and interactive visualization to be loaded and configured dynamically.

This example demonstrates integration of Project-χ and Chiasm.  Project-χ is used for data loading and parsing while Chiasm and Chiasm plugins handle configuration and data visualization.
