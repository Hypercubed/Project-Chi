# Force-Directed Graph

An example force-directed graph rendered in SVG (using [d3 v4](https://github.com/d3/d3)) and WebGL (using [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/)).

Based on Force-Directed Graph by [M. Bostock](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4062045).

This simple force-directed graph shows character co-occurence in Les Misérables. A physical simulation of charged particles and springs places related characters in closer proximity, while unrelated characters are farther apart. Layout algorithm inspired by [Tim Dwyer](http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~tdwyer/) and [Thomas Jakobsen](http://web.archive.org/web/20080410171619/http://www.teknikus.dk/tj/gdc2001.htm). Data based on character coappearence in Victor Hugo's Les Misérables, compiled by [Donald Knuth](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/sgb.html).
