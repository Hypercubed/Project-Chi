# Promoter discovery and definition in FANTOM5.

Venn diagram showing DPI defined peaks expressed at ≥ 10 TPM in primary cells (red), tissues (blue) and cell lines (green). 
Fraction of unannotated peaks observed in subsets of P, primary cells, T, tissues, C, cell lines, PT, TC, PC and PTC correspond to peaks found in multiple sample types, for example, PT, found in primary cells and tissue samples.
